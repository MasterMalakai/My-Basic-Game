# My-Basic-Game

I'm new to all this, here and programming alike. 

Injuries to my head has left me with some learning handicaps, basically just takes longer for it to commit. I like to think I'm smart, just a slow learner. I tell you this so you will understand why some of my questions might seems basic and obvious :/


With that disclaimer out of the road...

Here is my, what I like to call, "learning code" stuff. I want something, I go look for answers, I write the code, pull my hair out as to why it doesn't work, ask a millions questions and eventually it sinks in.

So far I have a Game State handler, doesn't work properly at the moment but it'll get there. I don't know how this all works, can you guys edit stuff around here? If I have a question about my code, where do I put it forward and where, if you can, do you answer it? ugh.. much noobness.

Q: the loadState() funciton takes a name for its argument and slots it neatly into a file path that will lead the load function to the main.lua file I want it to run. At the moment it runs mainMenu, in it some buttons that either run the game or closes the application. It works a treat, until I try to return to the mainMenu from the Game state. It loads a blank screen and I have no idea why?
